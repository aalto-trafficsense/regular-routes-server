This folder is like a cache. In theory all data here can be obtained by running the demo (`run_demo.py`), but this implicates contacting numerous servers (OSM, our own database) so I have kept these files here in the interests of running a quite demo, without needing a database (or even internet) connection.

The demo script should automatically check this folder for existing files before attempting to contact the server. Currently stored: traces (and maps) for devices 86, 98.
