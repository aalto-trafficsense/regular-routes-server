# A Note (from Jesse)

These files,

	delete_duplicate_device_data.sql
	snapping.sql

were there to start with. I added

	make_average_table.sql

which is the averaged location table, used by the Demo (`run_demo.py`). These other files:

	make_cluster_table.sql
	make_predictions_table.sql
	select_averaged_location.sql

were being constructed for use in a live system, although they were currently undergoing development.
